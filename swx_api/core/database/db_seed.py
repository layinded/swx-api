Database Seeding Script
------------------------
This script populates the database with initial data, including:
- Superuser creation
- Language translations

Usage:
    Run this script to seed initial data into the database.

Safety Checks:
- Prevents execution in production unless explicitly allowed.

Functions:
- `seed_data()`: Runs database seeding tasks.
- `main()`: Entry point with environment safety check.
